# CPU Scheduling Simulator (C++)

A simulator to visualize and compare different **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**.  
Implements classic scheduling techniques and shows **Gantt charts**, process stats, and performance metrics.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)  
- ✅ Shortest Job First (SJF)  
- ✅ Round Robin (RR)  
- ✅ Priority Scheduling  
- ✅ Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)  
- 📊 Gantt Chart visualization  
- 📈 Turnaround, Waiting, and Response time calculations

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gunajchugh05/cpu-scheduling-simulator.git
cd cpu-scheduling-simulator
````

## 📷 Example Output

```
Gantt Chart: | P1 | P2 | P3 | ...
Process Stats:
PID | Arrival | Burst | Waiting | Turnaround
--------------------------------------------
P1  |   0     |  5    |   3     |    8
...
```
