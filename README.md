# CPU Scheduling Simulator 🖥️ 

A simulator for CPU Scheduling Algorithms implemented in [your chosen language/framework].
This project demonstrates how different scheduling algorithms work and visualizes their effect on process execution order, waiting time, and turnaround time.

✨ Features

Implementation of all major CPU Scheduling Algorithms:

First Come First Serve (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF) – Preemptive & Non-Preemptive

Round Robin (RR)

Priority Scheduling – Preemptive & Non-Preemptive

Multilevel Queue (if implemented)

[Any other algorithms you add]

Visualization of Gantt Chart to show process execution order

Calculation of:

Average Waiting Time

Average Turnaround Time

CPU Utilization

Throughput

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

[Language/Framework] (e.g., Python 3.x, Node.js, Java, C++)

[Any required libraries, e.g., matplotlib, tkinter, etc.]

Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpu-scheduling-simulator.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd cpu-scheduling-simulator

# Install dependencies (if any)
[command]

Run the Simulator
[run command, e.g., python main.py]

📸 Screenshots (Optional)

Add screenshots of your simulator UI / Gantt Chart outputs here

📖 Example

Input:

Processes: P1, P2, P3

Arrival Times: [0, 2, 4]

Burst Times: [5, 3, 1]

Output (FCFS):

Average Waiting Time = 2.33

Average Turnaround Time = 6.33

Gantt Chart: | P1 | P2 | P3 |
